# DataScientist
#in this repository, I will keep adding some important part of codes and functions which a datascientist may need in his job and which i think is interesting to #look at after times. Hope you like it. Also, I started this repository for my personal use in mind to look back at my data scientis journey with Udacity. I just #started it but till now i am loving it.
